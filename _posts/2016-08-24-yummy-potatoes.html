<p style= "color:black"> First of all, please pardon the cheesy name -- I made up this recipe several years ago, and somehow, this just became the recipe name for my family. But I do assure you they are quite yummy! They're quite versatile, as simply with a different slicing technique, they can be transformed from breakfast potatoes to home fries. They're a mouth-watering side dish for any meal, any time of day (and I can personally attest that any leftovers are certainly able to be used later as a delicious snack).</p>

<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Ingredients:</span>
<ul >
  <li>Non-stick cooking spray</li>
  <li>4 golden russet potatoes</li>
  <li>1 small yellow onion, diced (optional, works well with breakfast potatoes)
  <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Directions:</span>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and lightly spray a large cookie sheet with non-stick spray.</li>
  <li>Cut up the potatoes -- either slice them into wedges (approximately 12 per potato) for homefries, or dice them into approximately 1/2 inch cubes. Place in a large mixing bowl (with diced onions, if desired).</li> 
  <li>Pour butter and oil over top of potatoes, and thoroughly mix until all potatoes are coated.</li> 
  <li>Add the salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder, and toss until potatoes are evenly coated.</li> 
  <li>Add the parmesan cheese, 1/8 cup at a time, tossing in between.</li> 
  <li>Evenly spread on the baking sheet, and place on bottom rack of the oven.</li> 
  <li>Bake for approximately 40 minutes, or until golden on all sides. For home fries, flip each fry 20 minutes into baking. For breakfast potatoes, flip every 15 minutes, ensuring that the potatoes are not sticking.</li> 
</ol>
