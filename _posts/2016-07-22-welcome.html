  <h4>Welcome to my blog, Under Pressure! I'm Kellie, a nerdy computer science student who loves to experiment with food and express my creativity in the kitchen. I've been working on the code for this website for about two weeks, so I'm excited to finally see it starting to come together!</h4>

<h4>I hope to fill this website predominantly with a collection of college student friendly recipes (and mouth watering photographs of said food), but also with some dishes that I enjoy making at home. I'm not a professional, but I am an avid watcher of Buzzfeed Food. I have fun with it and I hope you will too! </h4>
