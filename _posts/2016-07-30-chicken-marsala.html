<p style= "color:black"> A traditional dish, simplified. I'm always up for delicious and quick food. But for this recipe, you don't even need much to serve it - a bowl, a fork, and you're good to go. What else is there to want in a meal when you have chicken - that you can pull apart with your fork - smothered in buttery mushrooms and a luscious marsala wine sauce? Nothing comes to my mind. </p>

<p><span style="color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Servings:</span><span style= "font-size:15px"> 3-6 (depending on how hungry you are!) </span></p> 

<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Ingredients:</span>
<ul>
  <li>6 boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, diced</li>
  <li>12 ounces baby bella mushrooms, quartered</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
  <li>1/2 cup Marsala wine</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
</ul>
<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Directions:</span>
<ol>
  <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and then lightly coat in the cornstarch. Set aside remaining cornstarch.</li>
  <li>Press ‘Chicken/Meat’ to preheat the pressure cooker. As it heats up, add half of the oil, and then half the chicken. Lightly sear the chicken (less than a minute per side), and then remove from the pressure cooker pot. Add the rest of the oil, and repeat with remaining chicken.</li> 
  <li>Add the butter, and then the onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Season with the parsley and red pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Slowly mix the remaining cornstarch with the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until it is fully combined and a slurry has been formed.</li>
  <li>Return chicken to the pressure cooker, and pour in the stock and wine. While stirring, add the corn starch slurry, and then seal the lid. Adjust the time to 9 minutes</li>
  <li>At the end of the cooking time, quick release the pressure. Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
