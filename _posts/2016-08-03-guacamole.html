<p style= "color:black"> Call me basic, but I do enjoy a good avocado. That smooth, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture is perfect for a hot summer day. And what's better than turning avocados into guacamole? This is the way I like to do it, with juicy tomatoes and a little kick of heat, but all you really need is a ripe avocado and a pinch of salt. It's so simple, yet so delicious, perfect for a pick-me-up snack during exams or even just for a treat on weekends.</p>
