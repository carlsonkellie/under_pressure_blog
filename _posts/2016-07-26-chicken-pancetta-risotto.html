<p style= "color:black"> I love risotto. Come on, it's finished with butter and cheese -- what's not to like about that? For about four years, I've made risotto the traditional way, meaning I've stood at the stovetop for about two hours, gradually adding the liquid and stirring for an eternity. But recently, I discovered the magic of risotto in a pressure cooker. The prep time stays the same, but the rest is reduced to less than 15 minutes in the pressure cooker. Is it the same? Not exactly, but it's still 10/10 delicious and can be made without needing an afternoon free for cooking, and that's definitely worth it to me.

<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Ingredients:</span>
<ul >
  <li>6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, diced into large cubes (about 1 inch)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Coarsly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 onion, diced</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, finely diced</li>
  <li>6 slices pancetta, diced</li>
  <li>1 and 3/4 cups Jasmati white rice</li>
  <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
  <li>3 and 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
  <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
</ul>
<span style= "color:#552e6b; font-size:17px">Directions:</span>
<ol>
  <li>Season the diced chicken well with salt and pepper to taste and stir to combine.</li>
  <li>Press ‘Chicken/Meat’ to preheat the pressure cooker. As it heats up, add the oil, and 1 tablespoon of the butter to the inner pot. Once melted, saute the onion, garlic, and pancetta for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Working fairly quickly, stir in the chicken. Then add the rice, wine, and chicken stock, stirring in between each step. Season with the red pepper flakes and oregano. Press ‘Stop/cancel’.</li>
  <li>Press the ‘Rice/Risotto’ cooking button, and adjust the time to 8 minutes. Stir the risotto once more, and seal the lid.</li>
  <li>Microwave the peas in a separate bowl until hot, and set aside.</li>
  <li>At the end of the cooking time, quick release the pressure. Vigorously stir the risotto to develop the creamy texture, and mix in the parmesan and remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Then add in the peas and stir to combine. Leave to stand in the pressure cooker for several minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve topped with extra parmesan and black pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
